0. change the location of the project to C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop so that the background image of GUI can show up

1.open your IDE that can run java

2.this project uses mysql connector version 8.023

3. Open project -> "OurEdit2" in project folder

4. change in OurEditServer, Document and Users classes the jdbc link (root and password also) to your own jdbc link so you can link your own MySQL database to the project

5. add the OurEdit.sql to your database server, execute it and refresh to load the tables needed with sample data

6. Run "OurEditServer" class first

7.Run mmyedits class, which will start up the GUI

Now you can log in from any of the three users present in the users table once the login window shows up, or even create your own account if you're feeling brave

Happy trial!
